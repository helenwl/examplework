Thesis/project work from my Materials Science degree. 

This repo includes:

Work from Oxford Materials (MEng degree)
1. Two project reports in Materials Modelling (taught by Prof. Jonathan Yates) from my time as an undergraduate in Oxford. In the first project, I use Density Functional Theory (DFT) to examine several material systems and their properties. Using CASTEP, I calculate structural stability, density of states, and heat of formation of several materials systems. In the second project, I use the kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model to model a simple catalytic surface reaction and to investigate the variation of rate and diffusion coefficient as a function of different parameters.
2. My masters thesis, in the Oxford Electron Image Analysis Group, under Professor Angus Kirkland. Here, I build a convolutional neural network to identify the presence of sulphur defects in monolayer MoS2. I train the model using simulated images generated by the multislice method (MULTEM).

Work from Cambridge Materials (PhD)
3. My 1st year report on the applications of electron microscopy techniques to characterise pharmaceutical crystals. I focus on the solid form of different polymorphs for use in drug development.
