# examplework
Thesis/project work from my Materials Science degree. 

This repo includes:

1. Two project reports in Materials Modelling (taught by Prof. Jonathan Yates) from my time as an undergraduate in Oxford. In the first project, I use Density Functional Theory (DFT) to examine several material systems and their properties. Using CASTEP, I calculate structural stability, density of states, and heat of formation of several materials systems. In the second project, I use the kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model to model a simple catalytic surface reaction and to investigate the variation of rate and diffusion coefficient as a function of different parameters.
2. My masters thesis, in the Oxford Electron Image Analysis Group, under Professor Angus Kirkland. Here, I build a convolutional neural network to identify the presence of sulphur defects in monolayer MoS2. I train the model using simulated images generated by the multislice method (MULTEM).
